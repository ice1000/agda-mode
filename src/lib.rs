/*!
Accessing Agda's interaction mode via command line.
This library is created for [agda-tac](https://lib.rs/agda-tac).
It works with stable rust starting from 1.39.0.

 [agda#4183]: https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4183
 [agda#4209]: https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/4209

This crate will work only with master-branch Agda until Agda 2.6.1 is released.
Tracking issues for the feature are:

+ [agda#4183]
+ [agda#4209]

## Basic usage

Invoke [`ReplState::start`](crate::agda::ReplState::start) and await the REPL to be available.
That's the wrapper of the Agda REPL's state.

Then you may:
+ Invoke [`ReplState::reload_file`](crate::agda::ReplState::reload_file) to reload the current file
+ Invoke [`ReplState::command`](crate::agda::ReplState::command) to send a command to Agda
+ Invoke [`ReplState::response`](crate::agda::ReplState::response)
  to await for the next response from Agda.
  + Note that Agda sends json to `agda-mode`.
    The deserialized json type is [`Resp`](crate::resp::Resp).

There are more utilities to access Agda, checkout the library documentation to see all of them.

## Implementation notes

This crate deserialize json via `serde_json`,
and do async process io handling via `tokio`.
